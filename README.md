# Desiccation induced inflammation and ocular surface disease is suppressed by terminal state MRC1 conjunctival macrophages 
Abstract
Dry eye causes ocular surface inflammation and epithelial disease. Single cell RNA-sequencing and RNA velocity analyses revealed doubling of a terminal state macrophage population with a phagocyte signature expression profile (high Mrc1, C1qa, Apoe, Rxra) in the conjunctiva during 10 days of desiccating stress (DS) induced dry eye. MRC1+ macrophages are the predominant conjunctival phagocytes and comprise 41% of immune cells at day 10. Ingenuity pathway analysis showed activated macrophage phagocytosis and alternate activation, IL-10 signaling and PPAR/RXR activation and inhibited inflammatory (IL-1, IL-17 and IL-23 signaling) pathways in these cells. Depletion of MRC1+ phagocytes with mannosylated clodronate liposomes increased IL-17 and IFN- expression and percentages of T cells producing these cytokines, reduced IL-10 expression and worsened desiccation induced conjunctival goblet loss and corneal epithelial barrier disruption. These findings indicate that an RXR regulated phagocytic macrophage population increases in response to ocular surface dryness and suppresses dry eye induced inflammation.
